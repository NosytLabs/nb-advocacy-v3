        <p className="text-neutral-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
          New Brunswick is the only officially bilingual province in Canada, and its constitutionally protected dual 
          education system (English and French) creates structural challenges. While language rights are fundamental, 
          maintaining two separate school systems with declining enrollment means resources are spread thin across 
          both — contributing to schools operating at less than 60% capacity while per-student costs continue to rise.

          <ul className="space-y-2 text-neutral-300 text-sm">
            <li>- Reading (PISA): Last in Canada — both language systems</li>
            <li>- Math (PISA): Below Canadian average</li>
            <li>- Science (Grade 8): 87% at acceptable level — worst in Canada</li>

            <p className="text-neutral-300 text-sm">
              NB struggles to attract and retain qualified teachers, especially in rural areas and French-language 
              schools. Competitive salaries and working conditions are essential.

            <p className="text-neutral-300 text-sm">
              The curriculum hasn't kept pace with 21st-century skills demands. Digital literacy, critical thinking, 
              and STEM education need significant investment.

            <p className="text-neutral-300 text-sm">
              With 321 schools below 60% capacity, consolidation could redirect millions from empty buildings 
              to student programs, technology, and teacher support.

            <p className="text-neutral-300 text-sm">
              Reading gaps appear early and compound. Universal early screening and intensive literacy support 
              in K-3 could reverse the PISA trend within a generation.
