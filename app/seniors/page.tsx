            <p>
              New Brunswick has one of the <strong className="text-white">oldest populations in Canada</strong> — and one of the most severe shortages of nursing home beds. Seniors who need long-term care face waitlists that stretch for <strong className="text-white">months or even years</strong>. Many die before a bed becomes available.
            </p>
            <p>
              Those who are waiting occupy <strong className="text-white">acute care hospital beds</strong> — a phenomenon known as <strong className="text-white">ALC (Alternate Level of Care)</strong> patients. In NB, ALC patients occupy over <strong className="text-white">40% of inpatient beds</strong>, far exceeding the target. These are seniors who don't need hospital care but have nowhere else to go, blocking beds needed for surgeries, emergencies, and acute treatment.
            </p>
            <p>
              In <strong className="text-white">March 2026</strong>, a new nursing home opened in <strong className="text-white">Oromocto</strong>, joining the province's "Nursing Home Without Walls" program. The facility was welcomed — but the province itself acknowledged it <strong className="text-white">won't reduce the existing waitlist</strong>. Demand is growing faster than supply, and new builds only scratch the surface of the backlog.
            </p>
            <p>
              The problem is not just physical beds — it's the <strong className="text-white">workforce</strong>. Nursing homes cannot hire enough registered nurses, licensed practical nurses, and personal support workers at the wages being offered. Staff turnover is high. Burnout is endemic. The quality of care in some facilities has declined to the point where families fear placing their loved ones.

            <p>
              <strong className="text-white">Home care</strong> is supposed to be the alternative — allowing seniors to age in place, maintaining independence while receiving essential services. In NB, home care is <strong className="text-white">chronically underfunded</strong> and unable to meet demand.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong className="text-white">Home care workers</strong> — the people who bathe, feed, and care for NB's seniors — are among the <strong className="text-white">lowest paid workers in the healthcare system</strong>. Many earn barely above minimum wage. The result is predictable: recruitment is difficult, turnover is high, and rural areas often go without any home care services at all.
            </p>
            <p>
              The province's home care program provides a limited number of hours per week for eligible seniors. But the hours allocated often fall far short of what's needed, forcing families to fill the gap — taking time off work, reducing their own income, or paying out-of-pocket for private care they can't afford.
            </p>
            <p>
              For seniors living alone — especially in rural areas — the lack of home care services is not just an inconvenience. It's a <strong className="text-white">safety issue</strong>. Falls go unreported. Medications are missed. Malnutrition sets in. Without regular visits, isolated seniors can deteriorate rapidly with no one noticing.

            <p>
              Rural New Brunswick's seniors face a <strong className="text-white">double burden</strong>: they are older on average than urban residents, and they have far fewer services available to them. As younger people leave rural communities for cities, the remaining population skews older and more dependent — while the services they need are the first to be cut.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong className="text-white">Transportation</strong> is a critical barrier. Seniors in rural NB often live far from hospitals, clinics, and pharmacies. Many can no longer drive and have no access to public transit. A simple medical appointment can mean arranging a ride from family — if family is available — or going without.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong className="text-white">Isolation</strong> itself is a health crisis. Studies consistently show that loneliness in seniors is as damaging as smoking 15 cigarettes a day. In rural NB, where neighbours may be kilometers apart and community gathering places have closed, isolation is endemic.
            </p>
            <p>
              The province's response has been to centralize services in regional hubs — making access easier for those in Moncton, Saint John, and Fredericton, while leaving rural seniors with less than ever. This is not just a failure of healthcare. It is a failure of the social contract.

            <p>
              <strong className="text-white">Palliative care</strong> — the specialized care for people with terminal illnesses — varies wildly across New Brunswick. Access depends heavily on where you live, what resources your local health authority has, and whether you can afford private options.
            </p>
            <p>
              In urban centres, palliative care units exist within hospitals and some community settings. But in rural NB, palliative patients are often <strong className="text-white">left without specialized support</strong>. Home-based palliative care — which allows people to die with dignity in familiar surroundings — requires trained staff, equipment, and coordination that rural health networks simply don't have.
            </p>
            <p>
              The result is that many seniors in NB die in <strong className="text-white">acute care hospital beds</strong> — not because that's where they wanted to be, but because no alternative existed. The lack of palliative care infrastructure means suffering is prolonged, families are unsupported, and healthcare resources are consumed by end-of-life care that could be provided more humanely and more cheaply elsewhere.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong className="text-white">Medical Assistance in Dying (MAID)</strong> adds another dimension. Access to MAID requires assessors and providers — both of which are scarce in rural NB. Seniors seeking this option may face delays and barriers that defeat the purpose of the legislation.
