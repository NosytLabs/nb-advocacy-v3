            <p>
              The <strong className="text-white">Miramichi River</strong> was once the greatest Atlantic salmon river in the world. Generations of anglers traveled to New Brunswick to fish its legendary pools. Today, the salmon are nearly gone.
            </p>
            <p>
              Since 2012, adult salmon returns have <strong className="text-white">declined 64%</strong> (DFO data). In 2012: ~13,630 fish returned. In 2024: under 5,000. The <strong className="text-white">2025 season saw a further 69% decline</strong>. One-winter salmon have declined 79-86% across both branches. Only about 1,500 remain.
            </p>
            <p>
              The primary cause: <strong className="text-white">DFO allowed striped bass to explode unchecked</strong>. Over 70% of southwest Miramichi smolts and over 90% of northwest smolts are now eaten by striped bass before reaching the sea. Water temperatures hit a lethal <strong className="text-white">32°C</strong> in August 2025 — the hottest spot in Canada that day.
            </p>
            <p>
              In March 2025, <strong className="text-white">Save Miramichi Salmon Inc.</strong> filed a lawsuit in Federal Court against the Minister of Fisheries, alleging DFO mismanaged striped bass "either intentionally or recklessly." The same day, DFO announced a national salmon strategy — critics called it a coincidence.
            </p>
            <p>
              The <strong className="text-white">North Shore Mi'kmaq Tribal Council</strong> has proposed the <em>Plamu First</em> plan — a $38 million Indigenous-led strategy using "Two-Eyed Seeing" (Mi'kmaq knowledge + Western science). The province supports it; Ottawa has not yet funded it.

                Federal Court: DFO Sued for Salmon Mismanagement

            <p className="text-neutral-200 text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
              In <strong className="text-white">March 2025</strong>, <strong className="text-white">Save Miramichi Salmon Inc.</strong> filed a 
              federal lawsuit against the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, alleging DFO systematically mismanaged Atlantic 
              salmon by overprotecting invasive striped bass at the expense of native salmon populations. The group argues 
              DFO&apos;s policies have created an ecological imbalance where striped bass effectively &ldquo;eat the salmon buffet&rdquo; — 
              preying on juvenile smolts during their seaward migration and preventing recovery despite millions spent on 
              habitat restoration.
            </p>
            <p className="text-neutral-200 text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
              In <strong className="text-white">September 2025</strong>, Federal Court Justice denied the government&apos;s 
              attempt to dismiss the lawsuit — a significant legal victory for conservation groups. The case proceeds 
              on the merits, with DFO now required to defend its management decisions in court.
            </p>
            <p className="text-neutral-200 text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
              In <strong className="text-white">December 2025</strong>, the government again attempted to have the 
              lawsuit dismissed, arguing DFO has &ldquo;discretionary authority&rdquo; over fisheries management. The Federal 
              Court rejected this argument, ruling the case raises legitimate questions about whether DFO&apos;s management 
              decisions are evidence-based or politically motivated.

              In 2024, <strong className="text-white">MSX (Multinucleate Sphere X)</strong> — a deadly parasitic disease — was discovered in New Brunswick oyster beds near Spencer Cove, Northumberland Strait. The parasite causes <strong className="text-white">90-95% mortality</strong> in infected oysters. By fall 2025, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency declared all Maritime waters a disease-present area.
            </p>
            <p>
              The impact has been devastating. PEI's oyster industry (worth $54 million, producing 26% of Canada's oysters) is losing hundreds of thousands per operator. NB operators report losing "many millions" pulling up dead oysters. MSX had been contained in Cape Breton since 2002 — then suddenly spread to NB and PEI in 2024.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong className="text-white">The breakthrough:</strong> In February 2026, the <strong className="text-white">Research and Productivity Council in Fredericton</strong> became the <strong className="text-white">first in the world to sequence the full MSX genome</strong> — after 7 months of lab work on 17,000 infected oyster samples.
