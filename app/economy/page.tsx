            Crushing Poverty vs. Corporate Oligarchy
          </h2>
          <p className="text-neutral-400 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            New Brunswick is Canada's extraction zone. Plain and simple. 
            The February 2026 Child Poverty Report Card shows 21.9% of our kids 
            living in poverty. That jumps to 41.2% in Campbellton - nearly half 
            of all children there. In Saint John's Ward 3, it's 44.8%. For 
            Indigenous kids on reserves? 51.2% - more than one in two. 
            This isn't statistics. This is hunger. This is kids going to school 
            with empty stomachs while billionaires get richer.
          </p>
          <p className="text-neutral-400 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            32,140 children. Let that sink in. Over thirty-two thousand New Brunswick kids 
            wondering where their next meal is coming from. In Campbellton, it's worse - 
            nearly every other child is hungry. In Saint John's Ward 3? Almost every 
            second kid lives in poverty. This isn't a spreadsheet. This is real children 
            with real emptiness in their stomachs.
          </p>
          <p className="text-neutral-400 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            The wealth generated by the workers of this province is consistently
            siphoned out of the local economy through uncompetitive corporate tax
            structures and massive tax deferrals for giants like McCain Foods
            (whose farmland taxes are forgiven after 15 years). Meanwhile, 1 in
            4 New Brunswick households suffer from &quot;energy poverty,&quot;
            spending more than 6% of their income just to keep the lights and
            heat on.
          </p>
          <p className="text-neutral-400 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            The richest 10% of New Brunswick families grab nearly 23% of all income. 
            The poorest 10%? They get just 1.6%. This didn't happen by accident. 
            It's the direct result of policies that tax working families heavily, 
            give corporations sweetheart deals, let resource giants pay pennies for 
            our wealth, and starve social programs of funding.

            New Brunswick charges a <strong className="text-white">15% Harmonized Sales Tax (HST)</strong> — 
            the highest combined sales tax in Canada. This regressive tax falls

            One in four New Brunswick households — approximately <strong className="text-white">80,000 families</strong> —

            their after-tax income on home energy. In rural areas, where homes 
            are older, less insulated, and dependent on electric heating, the

            data shows that a cumulative 19.4% rate hike has already been 
            implemented, with more to come. For a family paying $250/month in 
            electricity, a 50% increase means $125/month more — <strong className="text-white">$1,500/year</strong>
