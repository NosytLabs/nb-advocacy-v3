            Rent control? Gone. Corporate landlords are jacking up rents by 50-100% and tossing families out on the street with fake &quot;renovictions&quot;. They call it upgrading. We call it theft. Every government in the last decade has chosen REIT profits over whether your kids have a roof over their heads.
          </p>
          <p className="text-neutral-400 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            "Renoviction" is a fancy word for kicking people out so landlords can jack up the rent. 
            In Saint John's north end - where families have lived for generations - whole blocks 
            are being cleared out. Seniors on pensions, workers making ends meet - given 30 days 
            to find somewhere else to live in a market where finding ANYTHING affordable is nearly 
            impossible. Vacancy rates? Less than 1%. Good luck.

          <p className="text-neutral-400 leading-relaxed">
            Moncton&apos;s story is just as brutal. The city&apos;s rapid population 
            growth — fueled by immigration and interprovincial migration — has been 
            met not with proportional housing construction, but with speculative 
            investment. Properties that rented for $800/month in 2020 now command 
            $1,500-2,000/month. The result: a city that was once affordable is now 
            one of the most cost-burdened in Atlantic Canada.

            Homelessness Explosion & The Addiction Crisis
          </h2>
          <p className="text-neutral-400 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            The numbers hit you like a punch to the gut: 830 people sleeping rough in Moncton. 437 in Saint John. 275 in Fredericton. Over 1,500 souls without a roof across our three biggest cities. And 440 kids - teenagers and young adults barely out of high school - tossed onto the streets in 2025 alone. This isn't just homelessness. It's abandonment.
          </p>
          <p className="text-neutral-400 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Instead of investing in deeply affordable social housing, historical
            responses have included the militarization of police, clearing
            encampments into &quot;red zones,&quot; and pushing vulnerable
            populations into the margins. Coupled with a toxic drug supply
            (carfentanil), front-line agencies reported over 100 deaths among the
            unhoused population in 2025 across Moncton, Saint John, and
            Fredericton combined.
          </p>
          <p className="text-neutral-400 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            The intersection of homelessness and the toxic drug supply crisis creates a 
            <strong className="text-white"> lethal combination</strong>. Unhoused individuals are disproportionately exposed 
            to a drug supply contaminated with carfentanil — an opioid 100 times more 
            potent than fentanyl. Without supervised consumption sites or adequate 
            harm reduction services, the death toll mounts monthly. Front-line workers 
            describe a system where <strong className="text-white"> naloxone kits have become as essential as blankets</strong>.

          <p className="text-neutral-400 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Youth homelessness is particularly acute. Over 440 young people aged 16-26 
            were identified as homeless in 2025 — many aging out of foster care with 
            no transition support, others fleeing family breakdown or LGBTQ+ rejection. 
            Without intervention, these young people face a trajectory of chronic 
            homelessness, addiction, and premature death.

          </h2>
          <p className="text-neutral-400 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            New Brunswick winters are among the harshest in Canada. Temperatures regularly 
            plunge below -20°C, with wind chill values reaching -35°C or colder. For the 
            1,500+ chronically homeless, winter is not just uncomfortable — it is a 
            <strong className="text-white"> death sentence</strong>.
          </p>
          <p className="text-neutral-400 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Emergency shelters operate at or above capacity throughout the winter months. 
            In Moncton, the only permanent emergency shelter has 70 beds for 830 unhoused 
            people. The city has relied on temporary &quot;warming centres&quot; — often 
            church basements or community centres — that operate only on the coldest nights 
            and close during the day, forcing people back onto frozen streets.

          <p className="text-neutral-400 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Hypothermia, frostbite, and cold-related deaths among the unhoused are 
            <strong className="text-white"> systematically underreported</strong>. Without a permanent address, 
            victims often die alone in camps, under bridges, or in abandoned buildings. 
            Their deaths are attributed to &quot;exposure&quot; in police reports that 
            never make headlines.

            The NB Power Squeeze

          <p className="text-neutral-400 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Compounding the housing crisis, relentless NB Power rate
            hikes—approved by a captured regulatory board—are pushing families
            into energy poverty. While massive industrial users in the &quot;Company
            Province&quot; receive heavily subsidized rates, residential users are
            forced to choose between heating and eating.
          </p>
          <p className="text-neutral-400 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            NB Power has requested <strong className="text-white">rate increases of up to 50% over the next six years</strong>, 
            with residential customers already facing a cumulative 19.4% hike. For 
            a household earning $40,000/year and paying $300/month in electricity, 
            a 50% increase means an additional <strong className="text-white">$1,800 per year</strong> — enough to 
            make the difference between affording rent and being evicted.
          </p>
          <p className="text-neutral-400 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            One in four New Brunswick households already suffers from <strong className="text-white">&quot;energy poverty,&quot;</strong> 
            defined as spending more than 6% of household income on energy costs. 
            In rural areas, where homes are older and less insulated, and where 
            residents depend on electric heating, the burden is even higher. The 
            province offers limited efficiency programs, but waiting lists stretch 
            for years.

          <p className="text-neutral-400 leading-relaxed">
            Meanwhile, Irving Paper received a <strong className="text-white">$45 million &quot;tariff relief&quot; grant</strong> from the 
            provincial government — funded by the same ratepayers struggling to 
            heat their homes. The message is clear: corporations get subsidies; 
            citizens get rate hikes.

            the provincial government has responded primarily with studies, committees, 
            and plans. The &quot;Overcoming Poverty Together 4&quot; strategy (2025-2030) 
            outlines aspirational goals but provides no new funding for emergency
