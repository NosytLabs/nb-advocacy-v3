            <p>
              In 2020, the <strong className="text-white">Wolastoqey Nation</strong> (representing six First Nations: Neqotkuk, Madawaska, Woodstock, Bilijk, Sitansisk, Welamukotuk) filed a landmark title claim over approximately <strong className="text-white">60% of New Brunswick's land mass</strong> — including vast Crown forests, hydroelectric dams, and land licensed to J.D. Irving Ltd. Unlike previous title claims in Canada, this one names <strong className="text-white">six corporate entities</strong> as defendants alongside the provincial and federal governments.
            </p>
            <p>
              The claim asserts that the Wolastoqey people never surrendered, ceded, or released their rights and title to their traditional territory. The Peace and Friendship Treaties of the 1700s — which the Wolastoqey signed with the British Crown — were agreements about coexistence, not land surrenders.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong className="text-white">November 2024:</strong> NB Court of King's Bench rules Aboriginal title <em>can</em> include privately owned land — a historic victory. But <strong className="text-white">December 2025:</strong> The NB Court of Appeal reverses this (<em>J.D. Irving v. Wolastoqey Nation, 2025 NBCA 129</em>), ruling Aboriginal title <strong className="text-white">cannot</strong> be declared over fee-simple private lands. The Wolastoqey have announced intent to appeal to the <strong className="text-white">Supreme Court of Canada</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
              J.D. Irving owns <strong className="text-white">650,000+ hectares</strong> within the claim area — land the Wolastoqey say was never legally ceded. The court's decision effectively protects the Irving empire from Indigenous land claims while acknowledging the Wolastoqey may be owed compensation from the Crown.

            <p>
              In the fall of 2013, members of the <strong className="text-white">Elsipogtog First Nation</strong> and their allies blockaded roads near Rexton, NB to prevent SWN Resources from conducting shale gas exploration on their traditional territory. They opposed hydraulic fracturing (fracking) — a process that injects chemical-laced water underground to extract gas, posing risks to groundwater and ecosystems.
            </p>
            <p>
              On <strong className="text-white">October 17, 2013</strong>, the RCMP deployed tactical units, snipers, police dogs, and over 100 officers to dismantle the blockade. <strong className="text-white">Over 40 people were arrested</strong>. Police vehicles were set on fire. The confrontation made national and international news.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Elsipogtog standoff became a defining moment in Canadian Indigenous activism — a modern echo of the <strong className="text-white">Oka Crisis</strong> and a precursor to the Wet'suwet'en pipeline disputes. It demonstrated the lengths to which governments will go to protect corporate extraction interests.

            <p>
              The <strong className="text-white">Peace and Friendship Treaties</strong> (1725-1779) were agreements between the British Crown and the Wabanaki Confederacy — including the Mi'kmaq, Wolastoqey, and Passamaquoddy peoples. Unlike treaties elsewhere in Canada, <strong className="text-white">these treaties did not involve land surrender</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
              They were agreements about coexistence: the Crown could establish settlements, and in return, Indigenous peoples would not be harmed and would retain their rights to hunt, fish, and use the land as they always had. These rights are constitutionally protected under <strong className="text-white">Section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Yet for over 200 years, successive NB governments have acted as though these treaties don't exist — granting logging licenses on unceded territory, spraying glyphosate on traditional hunting grounds, and allowing corporations to extract resources without Indigenous consent.

              <p className="text-white">
                15,000+ hectares of Crown forest sprayed annually with glyphosate — much of it on unceded Indigenous territory. The spraying kills plants that Indigenous peoples use for food and medicine, and contaminates waterways where fish live. Both Wolastoqey and Mi'kmaq leaders have called for a ban.

              <p className="text-white">
                J.D. Irving holds long-term licenses on 2.7 million hectares of Crown land — territory that Indigenous peoples never ceded. The company pays below-market rates and clearcuts forests for softwood plantations. The Wolastoqey title claim directly challenges these licenses.

              <p className="text-white">
                Thousands of Indigenous children in NB attended Indian Day Schools — separate from residential schools but designed with the same assimilationist purpose. The federal settlement program provides compensation of up to $200,000 per survivor, but advocates say the process is retraumatizing and many survivors haven't been reached.
