            <p>
              According to the <strong className="text-white">February 2026 Campaign 2000 Report Card</strong>, compiled by the Human Development Council, New Brunswick has a <strong className="text-white">21.9% child poverty rate</strong> — meaning nearly <strong className="text-white">one in five children</strong> lives below the poverty line. That's 32,140 children.
            </p>
            <p>
              NB has the <strong className="text-white">fourth highest child poverty rate</strong> among Canadian provinces. The rate was unchanged from 2022 to 2023 — the most recent data available — suggesting that despite government rhetoric about economic growth and opportunity, the benefits are not reaching the province's most vulnerable.
            </p>
            <p>
              As social researcher Heather Atcheson of the Human Development Council explained, childhood poverty leads to <strong className="text-white">"chronic stress, poor health outcomes, and long-term developmental impacts that can carry with them through life."</strong> These are not just numbers — they are children whose futures are being shaped by policy choices right now.

              Child poverty in New Brunswick is not evenly distributed. It is concentrated in specific communities — and the patterns reveal deep structural inequalities.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong className="text-white">Campbellton</strong> has the highest child poverty rate in the province at <strong className="text-white">41.2%</strong> — more than double the provincial average. This northern NB community has been hit by mill closures, population decline, and chronic underinvestment.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong className="text-white">Saint John</strong>, NB's largest city, has a 30.7% rate — but specific wards tell a grimmer story. <strong className="text-white">Ward 3</strong> has a 44.8% child poverty rate, among the highest in Atlantic Canada.
            </p>
            <p>
              On <strong className="text-white">Indigenous reserves</strong>, the rate is <strong className="text-white">51.2%</strong> — more than half of all children live in poverty. This is a direct legacy of colonial policy, underfunding of reserve infrastructure, and inadequate federal transfer payments.
            </p>
            <p>
              The pattern is clear: poverty in NB follows the lines of geography, race, and family structure. Northern communities, Indigenous communities, and single-parent households bear the heaviest burden.

          <div className="prose prose-invert prose-lg max-w-4xl text-white space-y-6">
            <p>
              In NB, <strong className="text-white">47.8% of children</strong> in single-parent households live in poverty — compared to just <strong className="text-white">11.3%</strong> in two-parent households. This four-fold gap reflects systemic failures in childcare, social assistance, and workforce support.
            </p>
            <p>
              Single parents — overwhelmingly mothers — face a impossible math: NB has the <strong className="text-white">highest HST in Canada at 15%</strong>, making every dollar of income worth less. Childcare costs consume a massive share of earnings. Social assistance rates are set below the poverty line, creating a welfare trap where taking a low-wage job can actually reduce total household income.
            </p>
            <p>
              The province's <strong className="text-white">$10/day childcare</strong> program has expanded access, but availability remains a challenge in rural areas and for non-standard work hours. Without affordable, accessible childcare, single parents are locked out of the workforce and locked into poverty.

              <strong className="text-white">Food insecurity</strong> is rising across New Brunswick. Food bank usage has surged in recent years, with demand far outstripping supply. The <strong className="text-white">15% HST</strong> — the highest provincial sales tax in Canada — makes food and essentials more expensive for families already struggling.
            </p>
            <p>
              School meal programs, where they exist, are a lifeline. But coverage is inconsistent — many schools lack breakfast or lunch programs, and funding depends on patchwork community donations rather than stable government support. For children in poverty, a school meal may be their only reliable meal of the day.
            </p>
            <p>
              The top 10% of NB families hold <strong className="text-white">22.9% of total income</strong>, while the bottom 10% hold just <strong className="text-white">1.6%</strong>. This extreme inequality — a Gini coefficient that worsens year after year — is the structural cause of child poverty. It is not inevitable. It is a policy choice.
