            On July 29, 2019, editorial cartoonist <strong className="text-white">Michael de Adder</strong> drew 
            a cartoon of Donald Trump standing over the bodies of Oscar Alberto Martínez Ramírez and his 
            23-month-old daughter Valeria — drowned migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border. The cartoon ran 
            in the <em>Washington Post</em> and went viral.

            That same day, Brunswick News — then owned by the Irving family — <strong className="text-white">
            rejected the cartoon and terminated de Adder&apos;s contract</strong>. The timing was not a 
            coincidence. The Irving family&apos;s business interests in the United States meant that 
            offending Donald Trump was unacceptable.

            The Media Monopoly: 90 Years of Control
          </h2>
          <p className="text-neutral-400 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            For over 90 years, the Irving family controlled the majority of English-language media in 
            New Brunswick. In 2022, they sold Brunswick News to PostMedia — a Toronto-based chain with 
            its own corporate ties. The damage, however, was already done: generations of New Brunswickers 
            grew up in a province where <strong className="text-white">the company that polluted their rivers, 
            clearcut their forests, and avoided their taxes also controlled the news</strong>.
          </p>
          <QuoteBlock

          <p className="text-neutral-400 leading-relaxed mt-6 mb-6">
            The consequences of media monopoly extend far beyond individual editorial decisions. When 
            a single corporation controls the primary news source for an entire province, it shapes 
            what citizens know, what they discuss, and what they consider possible. Environmental 
            contamination stories go unreported. Corporate tax avoidance is framed as &quot;job 
            creation.&quot; Government subsidies to billionaires are presented as &quot;economic 
            development.&quot;

          <p className="text-neutral-400 leading-relaxed">
            The NB Media Co-op, founded in 2009, has served as an independent counterweight — 
            publishing investigations that the corporate press refused to cover. But its reach 
            remains a fraction of the Irving-era dailies, which shaped public opinion for nearly 
            a century.

            During the 2020 New Brunswick election, J.D. Irving and ForestNB ran <strong className="text-white">
            full-page political ads</strong> in every English daily newspaper in the province, opposing a 
            glyphosate ban. Under the <em>Political Activity Financing Act</em>, any organization spending 
            more than $500 to &ldquo;publicly promote or oppose a political party&rdquo; must register as a 
            third party with Elections NB.

            Neither J.D. Irving nor ForestNB were registered. <strong className="text-white">Elections NB

            funded by grassroots donations, <em>was</em> properly registered — following the law that Irving 
            flaunted.

            Every PC and Liberal candidate refused to sign the pledge to end herbicide spraying on Crown

            Purging Academic Critics
          </h2>
          <p className="text-neutral-400 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            In 2019, instructors at the <strong className="text-white">Maritime College of Forest Technology</strong> in 
            Fredericton were purged after criticizing J.D. Irving&apos;s glyphosate practices. The college, 
            which trains New Brunswick&apos;s forestry professionals, was dependent on Irving for funding, 
            field access, and student placements. Criticizing the hand that feeds you is not permitted.
          </p>
          <p className="text-neutral-400 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            The pattern is consistent: when individuals or organizations speak out against Irving&apos;s 
            practices — whether in media, academia, or conservation — the response is intimidation, 
            defunding, or termination. This is how corporate capture operates: not through explicit 
            censorship, but through <strong className="text-white">structural dependency</strong>.{" "}

            The Irving intimidation playbook operates through a consistent pattern of
