            <p>
              The <strong className="text-white">Coleson Cove Generating Station</strong> is NB Power's largest thermal plant — a 1,050 MW facility that burns <strong className="text-white">heavy fuel oil</strong>, one of the dirtiest fossil fuels on the planet. Built in the 1970s, it was supposed to be a backup facility. Instead, it's become the backbone of NB's electricity system.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the 12 months leading to March 2026, NB Power burned nearly <strong className="text-white">4 million barrels of heavy fuel oil</strong> at Coleson Cove — a <strong className="text-white">60% increase</strong> over the previous year. This represents the most fossil fuel generation in 16 years, at a time when NB Power is publicly committed to being <strong className="text-white">net-zero by 2035</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
              The result: over <strong className="text-white">3 million tonnes of CO₂</strong> — more than NB's entire transportation sector. While other provinces shut down coal plants and build wind farms, NB is burning bunker fuel like it's 1975.

            The <span className="text-white">$5.9 Billion</span> Debt Trap

            <p>
              NB Power carries <strong className="text-white">$5.9 billion in debt</strong> — one of the highest utility debt loads per capita in Canada. The utility operates at only <strong className="text-white">27% capacity</strong> while buying additional power on the open market at <strong className="text-white">$9 million per day</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Every dollar of debt must eventually be paid by ratepayers. NB Power has requested rate increases of <strong className="text-white">50% over 5 years</strong> — which would push many households into energy poverty. NB already has the <strong className="text-white">highest HST in Canada at 15%</strong>, and among the lowest median incomes.
            </p>
            <p>
              Meanwhile, the province has added a <strong className="text-white">carbon adjustment</strong> of $49 million on NB Power, rising to $69 million by 2028-29. This cost is passed directly to customers — while the utility continues burning the fossil fuels that create the carbon tax in the first place.

              New Brunswick has some of the best renewable energy resources in Canada — particularly the <strong className="text-white">Bay of Fundy's tidal power</strong>, which could theoretically generate 2,500 MW, enough to power the entire province. Yet after decades of study and pilot projects, tidal power remains a rounding error in NB's energy mix.
            </p>
            <p>
              The province has been slow to adopt wind and solar compared to its Atlantic neighbours. Nova Scotia has over 600 MW of wind; NB has fewer than 300 MW. PEI generates over 30% of its electricity from wind; NB generates less than 5%.
            </p>
            <p>
              Critics argue NB Power's monopoly structure discourages renewable development — the utility controls all generation and has little incentive to allow independent producers or invest in decentralization.
