        <p className="text-neutral-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
          In March 2026, the Trout Creek No. 1 bridge on Maple Avenue in Sussex was closed after 90 years of service.
          Large cracks splintered its concrete foundation. A hole in the sidewalk exposed rebar, tunnelling directly to the icy creek waters below.
          The bridge scored 46 out of 100 on the province's own condition index - anything below 60 indicates need for significant repair.
        </p>
        <p className="text-neutral-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
          The closure doesn't just inconvenience drivers. Sussex's volunteer fire service can no longer use Maple Avenue as a corridor.
          Firefighters responding to emergencies must now take longer routes - minutes that could cost lives.

          The Sussex bridge isn't unique. The province expects nearly 300 bridges in similar condition, with a total repair bill

        <p className="text-neutral-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
          In March 2017, the federal and provincial governments announced <strong className="text-white">$94.4 million</strong> to 
          replace the 63-year-old Anderson Bridge on Route 8 in Miramichi — a critical link connecting northern 
          New Brunswick to the Trans-Canada Highway. The replacement was targeted for 2021.
        </p>
        <p className="text-neutral-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
          It didn't open in 2021. Or 2022. Or 2023. By 2023, residents were joking that the bridge 
          was "expected to open as early as 2046." Commuters endured a <strong className="text-white">29-kilometre detour</strong> for years.
        </p>
        <p className="text-neutral-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
          Then, on September 26, 2025, a boom truck with a raised hydraulic arm struck the old Anderson Bridge, 
          causing serious structural damage. The driver was charged — his licence was suspended.

          <strong className="text-crisis-red">Five weeks later</strong>, on October 30, 2025, the new Anderson Bridge 
          was open to traffic. After 8.5 years of delays, the project was suddenly completed in just 35 days.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-6">Roads: A Province Falling Apart</h2>
        <p className="text-neutral-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
          Nearly 42% of New Brunswick's provincial road network is rated as "poor" or "fair" condition. The province's 
          freeze-thaw cycles create devastating potholes each spring, but chronic underfunding means repairs can't keep 
          up with deterioration. Rural communities face roads that are essentially gravel paths, connecting them to 
          essential services.
        </p>

          <ul className="space-y-2 text-neutral-300 text-sm">
            <li>- Provincial roads: 18,000+ km, much built for lighter traffic loads</li>
            <li>- Pothole damage: ~$3,200/yr per NB driver in vehicle repairs</li>
            <li>- Rural routes: Many residents drive 45+ min on deteriorating roads to reach hospitals</li>
            <li>- Winter maintenance: Budget cuts mean fewer plow runs, longer closures</li>

        <p className="text-neutral-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
          Over 35% of New Brunswick's municipal water systems require significant upgrades to meet safety standards. 
          Many communities still rely on water treatment infrastructure built in the 1960s and 1970s, with 
          boil-water advisories becoming routine in some areas. Rural communities without municipal water 
          depend on wells contaminated by agricultural runoff and aging septic systems.

            <li>- Systems needing upgrades: 120+ municipal water systems</li>
            <li>- Boil-water advisories: Issued in 15+ communities annually</li>
            <li>- Lead pipe replacement: Thousands of lead service lines still in use</li>

        <p className="text-neutral-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
          68% of rural New Brunswick communities lack access to reliable high-speed internet (50+ Mbps). 
          In an increasingly digital economy, this isn't just an inconvenience — it's a barrier to education, 
          healthcare (telehealth), remote work, and economic development. While the province has pledged 
          connectivity targets, progress has been glacially slow.
