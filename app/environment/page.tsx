            The Wild Atlantic Salmon Collapse
          </h2>
          <p className="text-neutral-400 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            The Miramichi River was once the world&apos;s greatest Atlantic salmon river. Today, returns are 
            <strong className="text-white"> at historic lows</strong>. The culprit? A combination of 
            industrial forestry clearcutting, glyphosate spraying that destroys riparian habitat, warming 
            waters from deforestation, and a federal Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) that has 
            failed to protect the species from extinction.
          </p>
          <p className="text-neutral-400 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Despite catch restrictions on anglers, thousands of volunteer hours dedicated to river 
            enhancement, and millions of dollars spent on conservation, wild salmon returns continue 
            to decline. The fish are dying not from overfishing — but from <strong className="text-white">
            habitat destruction driven by corporate forestry</strong>.
          </p>
          <p className="text-neutral-400 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            The science is clear: glyphosate — classified as a &quot;probable human carcinogen&quot; by 
            the World Health Organization — kills the riparian vegetation that shades streams and 
            provides habitat for the insects salmon feed on. Clearcutting removes the tree canopy 
            entirely, raising water temperatures beyond the tolerance of cold-water species. Together, 
            these practices have reduced the Miramichi&apos;s salmon habitat to a fraction of its historical 
            extent.
