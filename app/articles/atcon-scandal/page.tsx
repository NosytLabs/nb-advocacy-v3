            $70 Million in Loans, Nothing to Show

          <p className="text-white leading-relaxed mb-6">
            In 2009, the Liberal government of <strong className="text-white">Shawn Graham</strong> approved 
            $70 million in loans and loan guarantees for Atcon, a Miramichi-based forestry and construction company. 
            The government argued the funding was needed to prevent major job losses in the region.

            But civil servants had warned that the company was likely to fail regardless — and take the

            taxpayers lost almost the entire amount.

            History Repeats: Travel Nurse Contracts
          </h2>
          <p className="text-white leading-relaxed mb-6">
            In 2024, Auditor General Paul Martin delivered a scathing report on $173 million in 
            travel nurse contracts. He described a litany of problems: contracts inked without 
            due diligence, rates of up to $300 per hour per nurse, and auto-renewal clauses 
            that could extend contracts beyond 2026.
          </p>
          <p className="text-white leading-relaxed mb-6">
            The parallels to Atcon were immediate. Liberal MLA Robert Gauvin called it &quot;one of 
            the worst economic scandals in the history of New Brunswick.&quot; Health Minister 
            Bruce Fitch responded by invoking Atcon: &quot;When he talks about financial disasters — 
            remember the Atcon scandal.&quot;
          </p>
          <p className="text-white leading-relaxed mb-6">
            The ghosts of Atcon continue to haunt New Brunswick politics. The question remains: 
            have we learned anything from losing $63 million in taxpayer money?
