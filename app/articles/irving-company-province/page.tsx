            As described in investigative reports, J.D. Irving&apos;s recent aggressive lobbying of Maine 
            state government on forestry and mining issues and Irving Oil&apos;s domination of Maine&apos;s

            In April 2025, the <strong className="text-white">New York Times</strong> published a major investigation

          </p>
          <p className="text-white leading-relaxed mb-6 italic">
            &ldquo;Even in a frequently fogbound port city along the Atlantic Ocean, the billowing clouds of steam 
            rising from Canada&apos;s largest oil refinery over Saint John, New Brunswick, are impossible to miss.
          </p>
          <p className="text-white leading-relaxed mb-6 italic">
            On a ridge overlooking the refinery sit six enormous tanks, each containing one million barrels of 
            crude oil. Letters painted in dark blue spell &quot;Irving,&quot; the family whose businesses dominate 
            not only Saint John, but most of New Brunswick.&rdquo;
          </p>
          <p className="text-white leading-relaxed mb-6">
            The Times documented Irving-owned railway tracks crisscrossing the city, linking smaller factories 
            owned by the family to ports under Irving control. Irving-owned building-supply stores and gas 
            stations dot the streets. Park signs honor Irving contributions to their upkeep.
          </p>
          <p className="text-white leading-relaxed mb-6">
            The investigation noted that Irving businesses are a major employer — but residents said those 
            jobs have come with <strong className="text-white">a steep cost</strong>.
