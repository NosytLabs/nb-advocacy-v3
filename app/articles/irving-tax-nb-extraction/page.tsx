      <h1 className="text-4xl md:text-5xl font-bold font-serif tracking-tight uppercase mb-8">Irving Tax: 5x Less Property Tax Than US Refineries</h1>

      <p className="text-xl text-white leading-relaxed mb-8">
        In any functioning democracy, the wealthiest pay proportionally. In New Brunswick, the <strong className="text-white">Irving family</strong> — worth an estimated <strong className="text-white">$14.5 billion</strong> — pays property taxes at a fraction of what comparable operations pay in the United States. This isn't a loophole. It's the system working exactly as designed.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4">The Property Tax Gap</h2>
      <p>
        Irving Oil's <strong className="text-white">Saint John refinery</strong> is one of the largest in eastern North America, processing over 300,000 barrels per day. Despite its massive footprint, the refinery pays property taxes assessed at roughly <strong className="text-white">one-fifth</strong> the rate of comparable facilities in the United States.
      </p>
      <p>
        How? New Brunswick's property assessment system allows industrial properties to be valued based on their <strong className="text-white">"current use"</strong> rather than market value. For Irving's vast industrial holdings, this means assessments that bear little relationship to what those assets would sell for on an open market.
      </p>
      <p>
        The gap isn't small. A comparable refinery in, say, Pennsylvania or Louisiana would pay $30-50 million annually in property taxes. Irving's Saint John operation pays a fraction of that. The difference is effectively a <strong className="text-white">subsidy extracted from every other taxpayer</strong> in the province.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4">2.7 Million Hectares of Crown Forest</h2>
      <p>
        The Irving family controls access to approximately <strong className="text-white">2.7 million hectares of Crown land</strong> — publicly owned forest — through long-term timber licenses. These licenses were granted at below-market rates and renewed for decades with minimal public scrutiny.
      </p>
      <p>
        To understand the scale: 2.7 million hectares is larger than the entire country of Jamaica. It represents a significant portion of New Brunswick's total land mass. The wood from these public forests feeds Irving's pulp mills, sawmills, and biomass operations — generating billions in private revenue from public resources.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the Wolastoqey Nation filed a title claim over 60% of New Brunswick — including much of this Crown land — the province spent millions in legal fees fighting the claim rather than addressing the underlying issue: <strong className="text-white">public resources being extracted for private profit</strong> while Indigenous communities receive nothing.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4">The Vertical Monopoly</h2>
      <p>
        What makes the Irving empire unique isn't any single business — it's the <strong className="text-white">vertical integration</strong>. The family controls:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 my-6 text-white">
        <li><strong className="text-white">Oil:</strong> Irving Oil refinery, terminals, and 900+ gas stations</li>
        <li><strong className="text-white">Forestry:</strong> J.D. Irving Limited — Crown land licenses, pulp mills, sawmills</li>
        <li><strong className="text-white">Transportation:</strong> Midland Transport, Kent Lines, fleet operations</li>
        <li><strong className="text-white">Construction:</strong> Irving-owned building supply chains</li>
        <li><strong className="text-white">Shipbuilding:</strong> Irving Shipbuilding — $25B federal naval contract</li>
        <li><strong className="text-white">Agriculture:</strong> Cavendish Farms — potato processing monopoly</li>
        <li><strong className="text-white">Media:</strong> Formerly owned all 3 English-language daily newspapers (sold 2022, but influence remains)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This vertical integration means that when the government makes decisions about forestry, energy, transportation, or media — Irving has interests in every dimension. Every regulatory decision becomes a potential conflict of interest.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4">The NB Power Connection</h2>
      <p>
        Irving Paper received <strong className="text-white">$45 million in preferential electricity rates</strong> from NB Power — a public utility. While residential ratepayers face 50% cumulative increases, a private industrial operation receives subsidized power from the same grid.
      </p>
      <p>
        This isn't unique to Irving Paper. Large industrial customers across New Brunswick negotiate confidential rate agreements with NB Power. The terms are not public. The rationale is "economic development" — the argument being that cheap power keeps factories open and workers employed.
      </p>
      <p>
        But the math doesn't add up. If cheap industrial power were driving economic development, New Brunswick wouldn't have Canada's <strong className="text-white">highest child poverty rate</strong> (21.9%) and one of the lowest median incomes in the country. The subsidy flows to corporate bottom lines, not to community prosperity.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4">The Media Shield</h2>
      <p>
        For over 90 years, the Irving family owned all three English-language daily newspapers in New Brunswick: the <em>Saint John Telegraph-Journal</em>, the <em>Fredericton Daily Gleaner</em>, and the <em>Moncton Times & Transcript</em>. In 2022, they sold to PostMedia — a chain with its own corporate interests.
      </p>
      <p>
        The effect of near-total media control is difficult to overstate. When one family controls the primary news sources for an entire province:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 my-6 text-white">
        <li>Stories about Irving environmental violations don't get covered</li>
        <li>Journalists who investigate corporate power face career consequences</li>
        <li>Public discourse is shaped by what the monopoly chooses to highlight — or ignore</li>
        <li>Political candidates learn quickly which topics are "off limits"</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The sale to PostMedia changed the masthead but not the structural reality. New Brunswick's media landscape remains one of the most concentrated in the developed world.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4">What Would Fair Look Like?</h2>
      <p>
        Reform doesn't require confiscation or radical change. It requires <strong className="text-white">normalization</strong>:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 my-6 text-white">
        <li><strong className="text-white">Property tax at market rates</strong> — matching what comparable operations pay in peer jurisdictions</li>
        <li><strong className="text-white">Crown forest license fees at market value</strong> — reflecting the true worth of public timber</li>
        <li><strong className="text-white">Transparent industrial electricity rates</strong> — ending confidential preferential agreements</li>
        <li><strong className="text-white">Independent media funding</strong> — ensuring journalism that serves the public, not corporate interests</li>
        <li><strong className="text-white">Environmental bond requirements</strong> — ensuring companies clean up after extraction</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        None of these are radical. Most are standard practice in other provinces and states. The only reason they're controversial in New Brunswick is that <strong className="text-white">the current system serves a very small, very powerful constituency</strong>.
      </p>
