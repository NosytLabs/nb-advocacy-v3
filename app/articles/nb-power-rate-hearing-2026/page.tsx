          <p className="text-neutral-200 text-base">
            The NB Energy &amp; Utilities Board is holding public hearings on <strong className="text-white">Matter EL-003-2025</strong> — NB Power&apos;s 2026-2027 General Rate Application. The hearings run daily at 9:30 a.m. at the Fredericton Convention Centre. <strong className="text-white">Watch live below.</strong>
          </p>

      <p className="text-xl text-white leading-relaxed mb-8">
        Starting today, the <strong className="text-white">New Brunswick Energy and Utilities Board</strong> is holding public hearings on NB Power&apos;s rate application for 2026-2027. This is the proceeding where your electricity bills for the next two years will be decided. The hearings are being live-streamed on YouTube — and we have embedded every stream below so you can watch directly from this page.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4">What&apos;s on the Table</h2>
      <p>
        NB Power has applied for rate increases that would see the average residential customer pay significantly more for electricity. This comes on top of a <strong className="text-white">50% cumulative rate increase</strong> over the past six years — far outpacing inflation and wage growth in a province with one of the lowest median incomes in Canada.
      </p>
      <p>
        The utility is also proposing a <strong className="text-white">&quot;net-zero rate premium&quot;</strong> — a voluntary higher rate for customers who want clean energy. Critics call this greenwashing: the same utility that burned <strong className="text-white">4 million barrels of heavy fuel oil</strong> in the past year is asking customers to pay extra for &quot;clean&quot; power.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4">The Numbers That Matter</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 my-6 text-white">
        <li><strong className="text-white">$5.9 billion</strong> — NB Power&apos;s total debt load, among the highest per-capita utility debt in Canada</li>
        <li><strong className="text-white">$9 million/day</strong> — what NB Power spends buying replacement power when its own generation fails</li>
        <li><strong className="text-white">3.8 million barrels</strong> of heavy fuel oil burned at Coleson Cove in 12 months</li>
        <li><strong className="text-white">3M+ tonnes</strong> of CO₂ emissions — a 16-year high</li>
        <li><strong className="text-white">4.75%</strong> — the proposed rate hike for 2026, compounding previous increases</li>
        <li><strong className="text-white">27%</strong> — NB Power&apos;s capacity utilization rate</li>
        <li><strong className="text-white">15%</strong> — HST on electricity bills (highest in Canada)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4">What Is the EUB?</h2>
      <p>
        The <strong className="text-white">NB Energy and Utilities Board</strong> is an independent quasi-judicial tribunal that regulates electricity, natural gas, pipelines, and motor carriers in New Brunswick. It was established to provide independent oversight of utility rates — a critical check on NB Power&apos;s monopoly.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, critics note that the EUB&apos;s decisions can be overridden by <strong className="text-white">cabinet order</strong>, effectively giving the provincial government final say on rates. This happened most notably with the Mactaquac dam refurbishment, where costs ballooned from $2.9 billion to over $4.5 billion.
      </p>
      <p>
        The EUB is holding these hearings at the <strong className="text-white">Fredericton Convention Centre</strong> in public. Anyone can attend or watch online. The Board will hear from NB Power, intervenors, consumer advocates, and members of the public before issuing its decision.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4">Who Gets Hurt?</h2>
      <p>
        New Brunswick already has one of the highest rates of <strong className="text-white">energy poverty</strong> in Canada. A 2025 CBC analysis found that low-income families spend up to <strong className="text-white">15% of their income on electricity</strong> — well above the 6% threshold considered &quot;energy poverty.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
        For seniors on fixed incomes, families in rural areas with electric heating, and Indigenous communities already struggling with infrastructure gaps, each rate increase represents a choice between heating and eating. The 15% HST (highest in Canada) compounds the burden.
      </p>
      <p>
        Meanwhile, NB Power gave <strong className="text-white">$45 million in preferential power rates</strong> to Irving Paper while asking residential customers to absorb increases. The question these hearings must answer: <em>who is this utility serving?</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        The EUB hearings are <strong className="text-white">public proceedings</strong>. You can:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 my-6 text-white">
        <li><strong className="text-white">Attend in person</strong> at the Fredericton Convention Centre</li>
        <li><strong className="text-white">Watch live</strong> via the YouTube streams embedded above</li>
        <li><strong className="text-white">Submit written comments</strong> to the EUB through their official website</li>
        <li><strong className="text-white">Contact your MLA</strong> and demand they attend and represent ratepayers</li>
        <li><strong className="text-white">Share this page</strong> — the more eyes on these hearings, the harder it is to rubber-stamp rate hikes</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4">The Bigger Picture</h2>
      <p>
        These hearings are not happening in isolation. They come at a time when:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 my-6 text-white">
        <li>NB Power burns more fossil fuel than it has in 16 years</li>
        <li>The utility&apos;s $5.9B debt continues to grow</li>
        <li>238,000+ New Brunswickers lack a family doctor</li>
        <li>1,500+ people are chronically homeless</li>
        <li>Child poverty sits at 21.9% (41.2% in Campbellton)</li>
        <li>The Irving family pays 5x less property tax than US refineries</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The pattern is clear: <strong className="text-white">costs are socialized, profits are privatized</strong>. NB Power&apos;s rate increases are the mechanism by which ordinary New Brunswickers pay for decades of mismanagement, corporate giveaways, and failure to invest in renewable energy.
      </p>
