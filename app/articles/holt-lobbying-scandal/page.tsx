            Brian Gallant: From Premier to Lobbyist
          </h2>
          <p className="text-white leading-relaxed mb-6">
            In February 2025, former Liberal Premier <strong className="text-white">Brian Gallant</strong> registered 
            as a lobbyist for <strong className="text-white">Aecon Group Inc.</strong>, a major construction company 
            that has worked on nuclear power and natural gas projects. His filing stated he wanted to organize 
            meetings with Infrastructure Minister Chuck Chiasson and N.B. Power CEO Lori Clark to promote 
            Aecon&apos;s &quot;corporate brand awareness and capabilities.&quot;

      </div>

          <p className="text-white leading-relaxed mb-6">
            The timing raised eyebrows. In December 2024, the Holt government announced a new natural gas 
            power plant in Scoudouc. Aecon has extensive experience in such projects. When asked whether 
            Aecon had the contract, Premier Holt said she &quot;did not know&quot; and had &quot;never met with the company.&quot;
          </p>
          <p className="text-white leading-relaxed mb-6">
            But the deeper issue is the relationship: <strong className="text-white">Susan Holt worked for Brian Gallant</strong>. 
            When he was Premier, Holt worked for a job-creation secretariat he created. Now, her former boss 
            is a registered lobbyist seeking access to her government.

            Shawn Graham: The Career Lobbyist
          </h2>
          <p className="text-white leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Another former Liberal Premier, <strong className="text-white">Shawn Graham</strong>, has also registered 
            new lobbying clients since Holt took power. Graham, a longtime lobbyist, added two new clients:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-3 text-white mb-6">
            <li><strong className="text-white">Fertility Partners Inc.</strong> — A Moncton fertility clinic. Graham says 
            his work is to help establish a research centre at the Université de Moncton, &quot;unconnected&quot; to 
            Holt&apos;s recent IVF funding announcement.</li>
            <li><strong className="text-white">Global University Systems Canada</strong> — A for-profit chain of universities 
            that operates three medical schools in the Caribbean. Graham&apos;s filing says he would meet with 
            Health Minister John Dornan about an initiative to &quot;help address the family physician shortage.&quot;</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="text-white leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Graham&apos;s lobbying career has spanned years. His registration for Global University Systems 
            raises questions: why would a Caribbean medical school chain need access to New Brunswick&apos;s 
            Health Minister? The answer likely involves the province&apos;s physician shortage — and the 
            lucrative contracts that flow from government efforts to address it.

            The Registration Loophole
          </h2>
          <p className="text-white leading-relaxed mb-6">
            New Brunswick&apos;s lobbying law requires lobbyists to register <strong className="text-white">&quot;within 15 days 
            after commencing performance of an undertaking on behalf of a client.&quot;</strong> Yet Gallant said 
            he became an &quot;advisor&quot; to Aecon in <strong className="text-white">early 2024</strong> — but didn&apos;t register 
            until <strong className="text-white">February 28, 2025</strong>.
          </p>
          <p className="text-white leading-relaxed mb-6">
            In a written statement to CBC News, Gallant said his February registration was his first ever 
            in the public lobbyist registry, which has existed since 2017. The delay between becoming an 
            &quot;advisor&quot; and registering as a lobbyist raises questions about whether he was performing 
            lobbying activities before formally registering — a potential violation of the 15-day rule.
          </p>
          <p className="text-white leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Gallant&apos;s own history makes this relevant. In 2017, he forced out one of his MLAs, Donald 
            Arseneault, for taking on lobbying work while sitting as a backbencher. Gallant said at the 
            time that while lobbying rules allowed it, it would be seen as a conflict of interest.

            The Lobbyist Wave
          </h2>
          <p className="text-white leading-relaxed mb-6">
            According to CBC&apos;s investigation, the Holt Liberal government&apos;s election triggered a wave 
            of lobbying registrations from Liberal-connected consultants:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-3 text-white mb-6">
            <li><strong className="text-white">Brian Gallant</strong> — Former Premier, registered for Aecon Group Inc.</li>
            <li><strong className="text-white">Shawn Graham</strong> — Former Premier, registered for Fertility Partners Inc. and Global University Systems Canada</li>
            <li><strong className="text-white">Three former Liberal cabinet ministers</strong> — All registered new clients since Holt was sworn in</li>
            <li><strong className="text-white">Two former Liberal advisers</strong> — Also registered new lobbying clients</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="text-white leading-relaxed mb-6">
            The pattern is clear: <strong className="text-white">those who served in previous Liberal governments are now cashing 
            in on their connections</strong> to the new Holt administration. The &quot;revolving door&quot; between government 
            service and lobbying is spinning faster than ever.

            The Irving Connection: Corporate Capture Continues
          </h2>
          <p className="text-white leading-relaxed mb-6">
            The lobbying wave isn&apos;t limited to former Liberal politicians. Corporate interests with deep 
            ties to New Brunswick&apos;s economy — particularly the Irving family — also have lobbyists 
            registered to influence the Holt government.
          </p>
          <p className="text-white leading-relaxed mb-6">
            In February 2026, the Holt government announced <strong className="text-white">$45 million in tariff relief</strong> for 
            Irving Paper — the same company that laid off 140 staff in 2025 citing &quot;uncompetitive rates.&quot; 
            The subsidy was announced while residential electricity customers faced a <strong className="text-white">19.4% rate 
            increase</strong> approved by the Energy and Utilities Board.
          </p>
          <p className="text-white leading-relaxed mb-6">
            The Irving family&apos;s lobbying power is not new. For decades, their companies have secured 
            favorable treatment from governments of both parties: below-market Crown forest rates, 
            property tax caps for industrial facilities, electricity subsidies through LIREPP, and 
            retroactive tax refunds. The Holt government&apos;s $45 million grant to Irving Paper is 
            simply the latest chapter in a long history of corporate welfare.
