      <p className="text-xl text-white leading-relaxed mb-8">
        New Brunswick's electricity utility is in a death spiral — and ratepayers are being asked to pay for it. <strong className="text-white">NB Power</strong> carries <strong className="text-white">$5.9 billion in debt</strong>, burns more fossil fuel than it has in 16 years, and now wants to raise your rates <strong className="text-white">again</strong>. This is the story of how a public utility became a vehicle for wealth extraction.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4">The Numbers That Define the Crisis</h2>
      <p>
        Let's start with the scale of NB Power's failure. These aren't opinion — they're from the utility's own filings and EUB proceedings:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 my-6 text-white">
        <li><strong className="text-white">$5.9 billion</strong> in total debt — one of the highest per-capita utility debts in Canada</li>
        <li><strong className="text-white">$9 million per day</strong> spent buying replacement power when NB Power's own generation fails</li>
        <li><strong className="text-white">27% capacity utilization</strong> — the utility runs at barely a quarter of its theoretical capacity</li>
        <li><strong className="text-white">3.8 million barrels</strong> of heavy fuel oil burned at Coleson Cove in 12 months</li>
        <li><strong className="text-white">3 million+ tonnes</strong> of CO₂ — a 16-year high for emissions</li>
        <li><strong className="text-white">50% cumulative rate increase</strong> over the past 6 years</li>
        <li><strong className="text-white">4.75%</strong> additional hike proposed for 2026</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4">Coleson Cove: The Fossil Fuel Machine</h2>
      <p>
        <strong className="text-white">Coleson Cove Generating Station</strong> is NB Power's dirtiest secret. Located near Saint John, it burns heavy fuel oil — one of the most polluting energy sources on earth. In the past year, it consumed more oil than any year since 2009.
      </p>
      <p>
        This isn't a temporary spike. NB Power's own data shows Coleson Cove has become a <strong className="text-white">baseline generation source</strong> rather than a backup. When the Mactaquac dam fails (which it does frequently due to concrete disease), when the Point Lepreau nuclear plant goes offline for maintenance — Coleson Cove fires up. And it stays on.
      </p>
      <p>
        The result? New Brunswick's electricity is now dirtier than it has been in over a decade, while the utility tells ratepayers it's committed to <strong className="text-white">"net-zero by 2035."</strong>
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4">The "Net-Zero Rate Premium" — Greenwashing 101</h2>
      <p>
        NB Power's latest proposal includes a <strong className="text-white">"net-zero rate premium"</strong> — a voluntary higher rate for customers who want "clean energy." Critics immediately called this what it is: greenwashing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Consider the math. The same utility that burns 3.8 million barrels of heavy fuel oil per year is asking you to pay <em>extra</em> to feel good about your electricity. There's no separate clean grid. There's no new renewable capacity tied to the premium. It's a surcharge that funds NB Power's general operations — including the debt from Coleson Cove.
      </p>
      <p>
        As one intervenor noted during the EUB hearing: <em>"You can't sell clean energy from a dirty grid."</em>
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4">Who Actually Benefits?</h2>
      <p>
        While residential ratepayers face relentless increases, large industrial customers have a very different experience. NB Power gave <strong className="text-white">$45 million in preferential power rates</strong> to Irving Paper alone. Large industrial customers negotiate confidential rate agreements that effectively subsidize their operations at the expense of residential users.
      </p>
      <p>
        The pattern is consistent across New Brunswick's captured economy: costs are socialized, profits are privatized. NB Power's debt is a public liability. Its rate increases hit the poorest hardest — families spending up to <strong className="text-white">15% of their income on electricity</strong>, well above the 6% threshold considered "energy poverty."
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4">The Mactaquac Disaster</h2>
      <p>
        The Mactaquac dam — NB Power's largest generating asset — has been suffering from <strong className="text-white">alkali-aggregate reaction (concrete disease)</strong> for decades. The refurbishment was initially estimated at $2.9 billion. That ballooned to over $4.5 billion. The EUB's scrutiny of these costs was effectively overridden by cabinet order.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every dollar of cost overrun flows directly to ratepayers. Every delay in the refurbishment means more fossil fuel burning at Coleson Cove to fill the gap.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4">The HST Hammer</h2>
      <p>
        New Brunswick charges <strong className="text-white">15% HST on electricity</strong> — the highest sales tax rate in Canada. Every rate increase is compounded by this tax. A family paying $300/month in electricity pays $45/month in HST alone. Over a year, that's $540 in tax on a basic necessity.
      </p>
      <p>
        No other province applies its full sales tax rate to residential electricity. Quebec charges 5%. Ontario charges the 8% provincial portion but rebates it for low-income households. New Brunswick offers no relief.
      </p>
