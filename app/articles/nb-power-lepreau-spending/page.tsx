      <h1 className="text-4xl md:text-5xl font-bold font-serif tracking-tight uppercase mb-8">NB Power Spends $88.4M on Hired Guns for Lepreau</h1>

      <p className="text-white leading-relaxed mb-6">
        New Brunswick Power is spending <strong className="text-white">$88.4 million over three years</strong> on outside experts from Ontario Power Generation to run the chronically unreliable Point Lepreau Nuclear Generating Station — a plant that has been offline for repairs and maintenance a total of <strong className="text-white">616 days in the last four years</strong>.

      <h2 className="text-3xl font-serif font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-6 uppercase tracking-tighter italic">The Laurentis Deal</h2>
      
      <p className="text-white leading-relaxed mb-6">
        The utility has struck a deal with Laurentis Energy Partners Inc., connected to Ontario Power Generation, to provide experienced nuclear managers to supervise Lepreau for at least three years. The arrangement includes <strong className="text-white">$8 million in bonuses</strong> in Year 3 if the plant performs better.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-3xl font-serif font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-6 uppercase tracking-tighter italic">No Investors, No Options</h2>

      <p className="text-white leading-relaxed mb-6">
        The move comes after NB Power failed to attract any private investors willing to partner on the nuclear facility. The plant's dismal reliability record — offline roughly <strong className="text-white">42% of the time</strong> over four years — has made it toxic to potential partners.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-3xl font-serif font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-6 uppercase tracking-tighter italic">Ratepayers Foot the Bill</h2>

      <p className="text-white leading-relaxed mb-6">
        NB Power is seeking rate increases of <strong className="text-white">50% over six years</strong> while spending $88.4M on consultants. Meanwhile, Irving Paper receives a $45M electricity subsidy. When the corporate monopoly fails, ordinary New Brunswickers pay the price.
