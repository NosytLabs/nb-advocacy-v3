          <p className="text-white leading-relaxed mb-6">
            <strong className="text-white">Policy 713</strong>, introduced in August 2020 under the Higgs government, 
            set minimum standards for New Brunswick schools to provide a safe, welcoming, and inclusive 
            environment for LGBTQ students. It was developed after extensive consultation with educators, 
            parents, and LGBTQ advocates.

          <p className="text-white leading-relaxed mb-6">
            The policy required schools to:

            <li>Respect students&apos; chosen names and pronouns</li>

            In June 2023, the Higgs government announced changes to Policy 713:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-3 text-white mb-6">
            <li><strong className="text-white">Students under 16</strong> must now obtain parental consent to use a different 
            name or pronoun at school. If parents refuse, the student must use their legal name.</li>
            <li><strong className="text-white">Teachers and staff</strong> are prohibited from using a student&apos;s chosen 
            name or pronoun without parental consent, even if the student requests it.</li>
            <li><strong className="text-white">School sports</strong> rules were changed to allow schools to restrict 
            transgender students&apos; participation based on &quot;competitive fairness.&quot;</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="text-white leading-relaxed mb-6">
            The changes made New Brunswick the first province in Canada to <strong className="text-white">roll back

            The Election Defeat
          </h2>
          <p className="text-white leading-relaxed mb-6">
            The Policy 713 controversy was not the only issue that plagued the Higgs government. His 
            confrontational style with federal counterparts, his handling of healthcare, and his 
            perceived indifference to the province&apos;s economic struggles all contributed to declining 
            popularity.
          </p>
          <p className="text-white leading-relaxed mb-6">
            But the LGBTQ policy was the breaking point for many in his own party. In the lead-up to 
            the October 2024 election, <strong className="text-white">over 40% of PC candidates resigned</strong>, 
            citing Higgs&apos;s leadership style and social agenda. In some ridings, the PCs couldn&apos;t 
            find replacement candidates.
          </p>
          <p className="text-white leading-relaxed mb-6">
            The result was decisive. <strong className="text-white">Susan Holt&apos;s Liberals</strong> won a majority 
            government, ending six years of Progressive Conservative rule. Higgs even lost his own 
            riding of Quispamsis — a seat he had held since 2010.
