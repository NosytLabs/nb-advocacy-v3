            Let's be clear: this isn't some small-time theft. We're talking about senior government officials 
            stealing over $1 million combined from the public purse. The Lieutenant Governor's principal 
            secretary and the Deputy Attorney General - the province's top legal official - both had their 
            hands in the till for years. And nobody noticed? That's not incompetence. That's the system

          </h2>
          <p className="text-neutral-400 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            The travel nurse scandal represents the largest documented case of public fund 
            mismanagement in New Brunswick&apos;s history. Canadian Health Labs (CHL) was paid 
            <strong className="text-white"> $300.72 per hour</strong> per nurse under untendered contracts 
            totaling <strong className="text-white">$173.9 million</strong>. For context, local nurses

          <p className="text-neutral-400 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            When the Auditor General attempted to investigate, the Vitalité health authority 
            invoked <strong className="text-white">&quot;litigation privilege&quot;</strong> to block access to internal 
            records. In June 2025, Chief Justice Tracey DeWare upheld this claim, ruling that 
            litigation privilege overrides the AG&apos;s statutory mandate to audit public spending.
          </p>
          <p className="text-neutral-400 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            The ruling effectively means that any government entity can shield its internal 
            records from the Auditor General simply by claiming that litigation is contemplated. 
            Critics call this the <strong className="text-white">&quot;legalization of corruption&quot;</strong> — a judicial

            Procurement Without Oversight
          </h2>
          <p className="text-neutral-400 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            The provincial administration routinely bypasses public tenders
            through &quot;Regional Economic Development&quot; (RED) exemptions.
            In the 2025-2026 period alone, Service New Brunswick utilized its
            full quota of <strong className="text-white">10 RED exemptions</strong>, awarding
            approximately <strong className="text-white">$10 million</strong> in untendered contracts to

          <p className="text-neutral-400 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            From hospital food supplies to curriculum materials,
            &quot;sole-sourcing&quot; has become the standard mechanism for
            funneling public wealth into the hands of the &quot;Two-Party
            Monopoly.&quot; The RED exemption system was designed for genuine 
            emergencies — situations where competitive bidding would cause 
            unacceptable delays. In practice, it has become a loophole for 
            awarding contracts to preferred vendors without transparency.
          </p>
          <p className="text-neutral-400 leading-relaxed">
            A 2024 analysis of RED exemptions found that over <strong className="text-white">70%</strong> were 
            awarded to companies with direct ties to sitting government members 
            or their families. The system operates on a simple principle: if you

            The exclusion is not accidental. Government consultants — who often

            Auditor General&apos;s statutory mandate. This effectively legalizes

          <p className="text-neutral-400 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Legal scholars have criticized the ruling as unprecedented in its
