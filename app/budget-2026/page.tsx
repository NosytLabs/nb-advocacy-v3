              🎓 Post-Secondary Education — Frozen
            </h3>
            <p className="text-neutral-300">
              Operating grants to universities are frozen — an effective cut when accounting for
              inflation. Affected institutions include UNB, STU, Mount Allison, Université de
              Moncton, and NBCC. The government previously proposed{" "}
              <strong className="text-white">privatizing Mount Allison</strong> and merging STU into
              UNB — proposals reversed after public backlash. Students organized protests at the
              Legislature on budget day.

              👔 Civil Service — 12% Reduction
            </h3>
            <p className="text-neutral-300">
              Part 1 of the civil service will be reduced by 12% over 3 years through attrition,
              projected to save $100M. This risks loss of institutional knowledge and increased
              reliance on consultants — which the budget simultaneously claims to reduce.
