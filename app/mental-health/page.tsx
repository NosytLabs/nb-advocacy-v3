            <p>
              In New Brunswick, people experiencing a <strong className="text-white">mental health crisis</strong> often end up in hospital emergency rooms — sometimes for <strong className="text-white">days</strong> — waiting for a psychiatric bed that doesn't exist. These patients are not receiving treatment. They are boarding. Sitting in hallways, in beds meant for heart attacks and broken bones, because the mental health system has no room for them.
            </p>
            <p>
              NB's emergency rooms are already among the most overburdened in Canada. With a <strong className="text-white">12.9% walkout rate</strong> — among the highest in the country — patients routinely leave without being seen. For psychiatric patients, the situation is even worse: the province lacks sufficient inpatient beds, so patients are held in ERs under observation, sometimes in restraints, sometimes sedated, waiting for a transfer that may take days.
            </p>
            <p>
              The <strong className="text-white">Horizon Health Network</strong> and <strong className="text-white">Vitalité Health Network</strong> operate the province's psychiatric services, but both are hampered by a lack of psychiatrists, nurses, and social workers. Rural hospitals often have no psychiatric coverage at all — meaning a person in crisis in Campbellton or Edmundston may need to be transported hundreds of kilometers to Moncton or Saint John.

              The root of NB's mental health crisis is a <strong className="text-white">severe shortage of mental health professionals</strong>. The province has among the lowest ratios of psychiatrists, psychologists, and social workers per capita in Canada. Rural areas are the hardest hit — entire regions function without a single psychiatrist.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong className="text-white">Psychiatrists:</strong> Wait times for non-urgent psychiatric referrals can exceed 12 months. Even urgent cases may wait weeks. The province has struggled to recruit and retain psychiatrists, competing with better-funded systems in Ontario, Quebec, and British Columbia.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong className="text-white">Psychologists:</strong> Private psychologists charge $200+ per session — unaffordable for most New Brunswickers, especially with no provincial insurance coverage. Community mental health centres have long waitlists, often 6-18 months for non-crisis services.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong className="text-white">Social Workers:</strong> Hospitals and community services are chronically short-staffed. Social workers in mental health settings manage caseloads double or triple the recommended standard. Burnout is endemic, driving further attrition from the system.
            </p>
            <p>
              The result: a system where people in need can't access care until they're in crisis — and then the crisis system itself is overwhelmed. It is a vicious cycle that disproportionately affects the poor, the rural, and the vulnerable.

              NB is experiencing a <strong className="text-white">crisis-level shortage</strong> of child and adolescent psychiatrists. Youth mental health referrals have surged since the pandemic, but the province's capacity to respond has not kept pace. Families report waiting <strong className="text-white">over a year</strong> for their children to see a specialist.
            </p>
            <p>
              For children and teenagers in crisis, the consequences of these delays are devastating. Untreated anxiety, depression, eating disorders, and self-harm escalate while families wait. Some are told to travel to Halifax or even further for care — an impossibility for families in northern or rural NB without the financial means.
            </p>
            <p>
              Schools are overwhelmed too. <strong className="text-white">School counsellors</strong> — already stretched thin — are often the first point of contact for youth in distress. But ratios of counsellors to students in NB far exceed recommended standards, meaning many children fall through the cracks before they ever reach the mental health system.

            <p>
              The <strong className="text-white">opioid crisis</strong> has hit New Brunswick's communities hard — particularly in <strong className="text-white">rural areas</strong> where addiction services are virtually non-existent. Fentanyl and carfentanil have driven overdose deaths to record levels, with toxic supply making every use potentially fatal.
            </p>
            <p>
              NB's response has been criticized as inadequate. <strong className="text-white">Naloxone distribution</strong> has expanded but remains insufficient. <strong className="text-white">Supervised consumption sites</strong> — proven to reduce deaths in other provinces — have been resisted by provincial governments. <strong className="text-white">Treatment access</strong> is limited: long wait times for addiction treatment mean people seeking help are told to wait weeks or months, often relapsing before they can be seen.
            </p>
            <p>
              Rural communities are the hardest hit. With no local addiction services, no psychiatrists, and often no counsellors at all, people struggling with substance use have nowhere to turn. The stigma of addiction compounds the problem — families suffer in silence while the death toll climbs.
            </p>
            <p>
              The intersection of the <strong className="text-white">mental health crisis</strong> and the <strong className="text-white">opioid crisis</strong> cannot be ignored. Many people self-medicate untreated mental illness with substances, creating a dual diagnosis that NB's fragmented system is unable to address.
