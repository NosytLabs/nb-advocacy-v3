            238,000 New Brunswickers - that's nearly one in three people in this province - don't have a family doctor. 
            This isn't just a waiting list. It's a death sentence. People with diabetes, heart disease, cancer - they're 
            left to deteriorate while the government spins recruitment numbers that mean nothing.

          <p className="text-neutral-400 leading-relaxed mt-4">
            121 people died in 2024-2025 waiting for surgery or diagnostic tests. 
            That's 121 New Brunswickers who showed up for appointments, got put on a list, 
            and never made it off that list alive. The province calls this a financial burden - 
            I call it negligence with a price tag.

            Need a specialist? Good luck. Try 12 to 18 months for a consultation. 
            Need cancer imaging? You're looking at 6-8 weeks when it should be days. 
            These aren't just delays - they're death sentences scheduled by bureaucracy.

            New Brunswick has 220 doctors per 100,000 people. The Canadian average? 260. 
            We train fewer doctors than any province. We hire fewer than 50 new doctors a year while 
            retirements leave us behind. More patients. Fewer doctors. Longer waits. People dying.

            February 2026. Health officials finally admit what we've known for years: our hospitals are now nursing homes. 
            40% of every hospital bed meant for sick people? Occupied by seniors waiting for long-term care. 
            There's literally no room for the acutely ill.
          </p>
          <p className="text-neutral-400 leading-relaxed">

            The numbers are staggering. Horizon Health Network reported <strong className="text-white">635 ALC (Alternate Level of Care) patients</strong> occupying acute 
            hospital beds in early 2026 — nearly double the target capacity of 330. These are 
            seniors who no longer require hospital-level care but have nowhere else to go. Every 
            ALC patient in an acute bed represents an ER patient who cannot be admitted, creating 
            a cascading bottleneck that drives up wait times, walkout rates, and preventable deaths.

            The <strong className="text-white">$173.9 million</strong> Travel Nurse scheme represents
            the largest transfer of public health wealth to private agencies in
            provincial history. Canadian Health Labs (CHL) was paid{" "}
            <strong className="text-white">$300.72 per hour</strong> per nurse—while local staff were

          <p className="text-neutral-400 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            The scale of the scandal is breathtaking. For context, $173.9 million could have 
            funded <strong className="text-white">approximately 2,500 full-time nursing positions</strong> at average 
            NB salaries for an entire year. Instead, the money was funneled through a private 
            agency that charged four to five times the hourly rate of local nurses — with 
            no competitive bidding, no public tender, and no transparency.
          </p>
          <p className="text-neutral-400 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            The Auditor General&apos;s investigation revealed that the Vitalité
            health authority used &quot;litigation privilege&quot; to block
            access to internal records about the contracts. In June 2025, Chief
            Justice Tracey DeWare ruled this privilege overrides the AG&apos;s
            statutory mandate — effectively legalizing the cover-up.

            six times their wages — the remaining staff face even heavier workloads. The 
            New Brunswick Nurses Union (NBNU) has repeatedly warned that the system has reached 
            a <strong className="text-white">&quot;critical juncture.&quot;</strong>
          </p>
          <p className="text-neutral-400 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            The crisis extends beyond emergency departments. Nurses in long-term care facilities 
            report ratios of <strong className="text-white">1 nurse to 30+ patients</strong> during night shifts — 
            well above safe limits. Mental health nurses describe being the only provider for 
            entire units. Community health nurses cover geographic areas so large that 
            patient visits are routinely cut short.
          </p>
          <p className="text-neutral-400 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            In response to these conditions, nurses have organized increasingly visible actions: 
            information pickets outside hospitals, public testimonials about working conditions, 
            and formal complaints to regulatory bodies. The NBNU has called for a full public 
            inquiry into healthcare staffing, arguing that the current trajectory is 
            <strong className="text-white"> unsustainable and dangerous</strong>.{" "}

            The Gender-Affirming Care Gap
          </h2>
          <p className="text-neutral-400 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            As of March 2026, transgender health advocates are calling for the
            establishment of a dedicated gender-affirming care clinic in New
            Brunswick. The province currently lacks any centralized resource for
            transgender healthcare, forcing patients to navigate a patchwork of
            reluctant providers or leave the province entirely.{" "}
            <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-crisis-text hover:text-white underline">[CBC NB, Mar 2026]</a>
          </p>
          <p className="text-neutral-400 leading-relaxed">
            Advocates describe a system where transgender patients face <strong className="text-white">multi-year waits</strong> for 
            initial endocrinology appointments, with no dedicated pathways for hormone therapy 
            or surgical referrals. Some patients report being told by family physicians that 
            they are &quot;not comfortable&quot; providing gender-affirming care — effectively 
            refusing treatment. The result is a population forced to either self-medicate 
            with unregulated hormones or leave New Brunswick entirely for care available 
            in other provinces.

        <p className="text-neutral-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
          In March 2026, Aimee Dunn settled her negligence lawsuit against Horizon Health and four doctors 
          after delivering a stillborn girl at Chalmers Hospital in Fredericton in 2022. She arrived at the 
          emergency department in pain — no one checked on her unborn baby. By morning, the fetus had no heartbeat.
        </p>
        <p className="text-neutral-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
          Her lawyer, who is also an emergency medicine physician, called it a <strong className="text-white">&quot;summation of things&quot;</strong> — 
          failures to consider life-threatening diagnoses, failures to check on the fetus, failures to communicate 
          among doctors, nurses, and obstetrical teams. The case was settled out of court. Horizon Health declined to comment.
        </p>
        <p className="text-neutral-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
          This is the same emergency department where Darrell Mesheau, 78, died alone. Dunn said she was 
          &quot;angry&quot; when she heard about his death — she had felt &quot;overlooked and dismissed&quot; in the same ER.

        <p className="text-neutral-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
